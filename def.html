          <dt>I.Human-caused Emissions:</dt>

            <p>•	Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important GHG that comes from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), from wildfires, and from natural processes like volcanic eruptions. Since the onset of industrial times in the 18th century, human activities have raised atmospheric CO2 by 50% – meaning the amount of CO2 is now 150% of its value in 1750. This human-induced rise is greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age, 20,000 years ago.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Absorption of emissions by natural systems:  Atmospheric CO2 increases represent a balance between fossil fuel emissions and land and ocean carbon sinks, which absorb about half of human emissions each year.GHG emissions from natural systems: Though CH4 is emitted from a variety of human activities (oil and natural gas production and use, agriculture, waste), about 30% of global emissions come from natural sources. Emissions from microbial sources like wetlands can increase as global temperatures warm and the health of many coastal wetland areas are threatened by rising sea levels</p>

          <dt>III.Policy and scientific challenge:</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The path to addressing climate change relies on reducing human-caused emissions and preserving or even enhancing the ability of natural carbon sinks to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. To enable policymakers to set emissions reduction targets that limit warming and to manage the critical ecosystems that have helped slow climate change to date, high quality, spatially detailed information about the location and vulnerability of natural sources and sinks around the world is urgently needed</p>

          <dt>IV.Large Emission Events Methane emissions:</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Methane is a flammable gas that is invisible to the human eye. Natural gas has a methane content of around 95% in the United States. Because it is used widely for heating and cooking there are distribution systems for natural gas throughout our cities and towns. While most methane emissions come from the waste sector (landfills, wastewater treatment), and agriculture (livestock and rice farming) methane is also released during coal mining and the production, transport, and processing of oil and natural gas.</p>
